Here Lies
- Miegrat Sammri


Here lies the lonely traveller,
alone in life, now alone in death.
Never sought a travelling companion,
he was a one-man champion.

Here lies the aimless pioneer,
dwelling on regrets of the past.
Never lived for the present,
nor thought to better his future’s cast.

Here lies the guilt bearer,
Guilty of things he did do good,
Guilty of things he did gone wrong,
Even guilty of what never happened, but could happen.

Here lies the frantic burden on earth,
Just as frantic to leave the said world,
The anxiety that was gifted to him at birth,
The cure to which is hidden deep in his funeral hearth.

Incinerate me; no, don’t cremate me,
for I am a sorrowful disappointment
Don’t even bother; just bury me,
Let my grave bear this testament.

Engraved upon my tombstone shall read
words of baffling truth, a dark decree:
"Here rests the hopeless wanderer,
Trapped in life, now free in death..."
