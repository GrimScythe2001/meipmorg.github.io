Farewell (school and friends)
- Miegrat Sammri

To all my dear friends who made my school life wonderful!


Seven hours felt like a waste,
Silent in the classroom I sat,
Learnt naught, nor listened tad bit,
Drifting in my dream world, I was lost.

Nodding and dozing,
Off I slid into sleep,
My eyes stayed open though,
I know they were,
But my mind, I was never sure.

The ring of the bell,
How sweet and melodious it sounded,
When teacher took leave, the panic relieved,
The joy that erupted had no bound, I believe.

Exams arrived, and exams went by,
But result day is what we feared,
The harsh scolding, and the words so searing,
Yet strangely, to us, those were dear.

Books became our sleeping pills,
While games period was the vigour giver,
Teachers taught us how to believe,
But friends made us true believers.

Doing assignments felt like mere procrastination,
A burden that we'll never forget,
They gave us months' time; transient weeks had gone by,
The work would still be undone.

Those were the days, those were the times,
I shall forever frame in my mind,
Saying goodbye may not pain much,
If only we promise to stay in touch.
