I Write...
- Miegrat Sammri


I write
Hoping someday my words are seen,
That my hobbies may bloom into something amazing,  
And thence I write to make my dreams breathe.

I write
Not because I cannot speak,
But because my voice cannot reverb as deep,
And thence I write to pour my heart open.

I write
To calm the storm in my mind,
To keep the voices from devouring me whole,
And thence I write to save myself.

I write
So I can commensurate the thoughts I spill,
In ink, I see what I cannot elucidate in silence.
And thence I write to learn myself.

I write
To cast my old thoughts away,
Foster wisdom to a new life ahead,
And thence I write to revise my head.

I write 
Because unlike people, 
Paper never scorns what I have to say,
It listens, patient, unjudging. It understands me.
And thence I write because that is how I can reveal myself.

I write
Not because I am great at it,
But to remind myself I am at least trying,
Doing what so many are afraid to do,
And so I write to keep myself inspired.
