Monster
- Miegrat Sammri


There’s a monster in my closet,  
And he’s terrified of me.  
I would never harm him,  
But he doesn't believe it.  

Each night I watch him watch me,
His trembling plenty clear.
He quivers, he shakes,  
Chained to a purpose, a pity, he can’t forsake.

Rumbling in his cold eyes, I see his patent fear.
Entrapped in his shivers, I see my reflection sheer.
Afterall, we are two bodies, one mind shared.
Some late nights, I must ponder,
If I am his worst nightmare.

It amuses me to contemplate it all,
How the tables have turned.
Compared to the monster under my bed,
Or the shadow in my wall,
I am the worst spawn.

I don't understand what sin of mine,
Ignited that fear in him,
I have always worn a pretty mask of good,
Makes me wonder if he's seen the corroded core within.

I swear I speak the truth,
I am no threat, I am no beast.
Perhaps you don't believe me,
But allow me to confess at least,
This aforementioned closet is my vague mind, 
And the wimpy monster is me.
