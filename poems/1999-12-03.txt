Touchdown from Heaven to Hell
- Miegrat Sammri


There would be a grand event
A touchdown from heaven to hell
It was a proper plan alright
But it would never come to pass

Or so it was said
For it was a gloomy day
The rumours travelled far and wide
A child so depressed
He was crafted in the holy dales of the holy heaven

Written on dark paper with the dark ink
He was the darkest of the dark beings
The child was cursed with damnation
His destiny was to complete the final touchdown

It was but a one-way approved plan
The plan of the merciless playful gods
The devil was not involved
Nor was he informed to begin with

The rumour was quick to reach a demon's ears
A swindler swindling on the lands of human
Pleased with this spicey hold, it reported directly back to hell
The devil was now madly aware

Oh, gods! The plan forged in heaven
Sought no approval of hell
It was meant to be a touchdown
But would soon turn out to be a cold war

The devil had now weaved a ploy of his own
He had the power to deny entry to the land of the dead
He watched with his wakeful eyes
The child being sent to the land of the living
The second phase had now begun
The touchdown was coming to an end

Knock knock knocking on the hellbound's door
Here appears an angelic messenger
"There is an event so grand, and I bring you your invitation at hand." The angel said
Too late, the devil's ego was already hurt
"Oh! But I know." The devil replied
"Why don't you come in, it's quite late
Feast with us for a bit" and take the bait
The angelic prisoner of war was escorted in
But was the angel aware? Of course not!

The gods had done what they pleased for far too long
It was now devil's turn to take over this almighty's plan
A glass of pit's twisted mead was all it needed
To spill the beans from the angel's very mouth undebated

Caught in between this mess was that innocent child
Already left heaven, a denied entry to hell
Admitted to Earth, the child remained stuck without help

Seeing the plan go awry, the almighty now grew angry
Took matters into his own hands and summoned the devil to his hall
A heated discussion took place, the arrogant almighty could not be wronged
But the devil was not new to this type of confrontation
For he had once before witnessed this similar wrath of his father, the almighty
When he was thrown out of heaven himself, so he was not afraid of the pitiless god anymore

In the meantime, the celestials had forgotten
The time on Earth passed much quicker than in heaven or in hell
The child had grown and with him grew the curse that was put on him

Whisperings inside his head, controlled by the curse
To complete the damned destiny that was bound to him
Many times did the child try to take his own life
But little did he know, the devil had not yet prepared for his arrival

So he tried and tried and tried to kill himself
All but in vain
Tossed like a ragdoll, against his free will
Pain and suffering remained his only friends

Up in the great halls, the meeting has now concluded
Gods are too proud to admit their wrongdoing
The devil even prouder, will not budge until the gods apologise for their sins
All in all, the merciless gods agreed that the event will now be buried down in mist
And shockingly, the child, who's no longer a child, be let to live on his inept life with no guidance at hand

The Earth will be his home
But with the dark aura that he carries
Will the earthlings accept him?
The Earth will be his home
But will he embrace it?

For the time being, the Earth shall be my home
For the time being, I accept this to be my reality
But in the meantime, oh the greater force, realise this
I may have been forgotten, the event may have been forgotten
Even though you don't have your watchful eyes set upon me
I will not forget

I will not forget my true purpose
I was an experiment, a broken product that was never meant to ship
But I have a few tricks up my sleeves, afterall, the broken pieces hurt the most
I will trick the devil, I will endure the pain, and I will fulfil my destiny

In the end, I shall rest peacefully in hell as intended
I have faith, the devil will show me mercy
The touchdown shall come to an end! if not by your will then by my wrath
One way or the other, this grand event shall come to a grand end!
I will bring peace to me, I will bring me freedom
I will put an end, to this event that has me cursed!
