Trouble Sleeping
- Miegrat Sammri


There used to be a time  
when I would hear people muttering,  
"I have trouble sleeping."  

"How pathetic," I used to think.  
"How can you not sleep?  
It’s sleeping.
You close your eyes,  
you drift,  
you rest.  
I’ll never have this problem in my life."  

And yet,
here I lay.  
Restless.  
Sleepless.  
Insomniac.  

What troubles me, I do not know.
It is this life that ails me,
I should have known.
