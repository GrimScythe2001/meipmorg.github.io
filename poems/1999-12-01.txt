Unguided
- Miegrat Sammri


How do you hear the whisper of life
My life has never whispered to me
Your life's a fun adventure, you say
Yet all I see is pain strewn along my lane

Am I treading the right path, or am I lost?
How long has it been since I swayed away?
I cannot tell the time; it's night always
Has the sun forgotten it needs to shine upon my path as well?

I see a glimmer, a shining something
Never mind, I blinked, and it vanished again
It’s like a faded dream, naught but shades of grey
For so long, I've been pacing this way

My feet hurt, but I cannot stop
I must find a safe haven first
All these thorns scattered along my way
How is it fair, when it pierces whether I stand still or break away?

It feels as if a dirty joke is being played on me
Unguided, I’m led to grasp a rope that isn’t there
Stop, walk, or run I may, on this uncharted land
In vain, I am laboured to bleed for a dead end

How do you hear the melody of life?
My life has never hummed to me
I've lost the rhythm of life
Now it's just me and the noise I make, all the life's notes,
long burned away
