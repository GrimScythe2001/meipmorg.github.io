Hear My Defeat
- Miegrat Sammri


A thundering rhythm, a thumping beat,
let me sing you the song of my shameful defeat.

A mighty champion made to fall on earth,
instead he gave up from the moment of his birth.

A rebel, some might call him, but he was not,
pity the poor young soul, it was not his fault.

Clueless and mindless, he kept wandering the wild,
searching for the victory he was told to find.

People, people everywhere,
wherever he tread, more people there.

Thought he was unique, thought he was special,
years went by, he learned of those far more favoured.

An incidental chunk of mass he was,
ungrateful of the wondrous, nay, abysmal life he has.

So that’s a brief of what the champion thought,
sorry for your lost time, ya’ lot.

Hope your day’s not ruined by this hopeless poem,
eh, what do I care what happens to you?
I won’t even bother rhyming this last line.
