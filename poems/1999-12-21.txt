I Wish To Be Forgotten
- Miegrat Sammri

 
Not a care in this world,
I wish I could just vanish,
From the gaze of every eye,
Like I'd cease to exist.
 
Fade from the minds of those,
Where my memory still lingers,
Step off the crossroads to those,
Whose paths I once shared.
 
I could then die in content,
Erased from the minds of those,
Who still hold me close,
For living is thought,
To be alive is to linger as an echo in someone's thought.
So when I am forgotten for good,
I am no more alive.
Only then am I truly dead.
