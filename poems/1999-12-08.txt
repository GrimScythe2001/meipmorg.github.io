Slave
- Miegrat Sammri


Breathing in this pollution, this rotten air,
Life has gotten hard; It’s only harder to bear.
Sat in the back of a public bus, face down, a sad slave,
Watching towers drift past, destiny steering me into an abyss.

Can I do this for the rest of my life?
Will I have to do this for the rest of my life?
Will luck ever favour me in this life? 
I’m all in for the hype,
To emerge from the pit of this pathetic fate is all I care,
Yet I do not dare,
I do not make lemonade when life gives me lemons, 
Rather I turn away from the sun. I turn to my demons.

I like being neglected, the same way I neglect my today,
Pushing away my chances, just to repent them later.
Injecting lost causes into my veins gives me the high,
To bid the thought of good things happening to me goodbye.

I'll be playing victim for the rest of my life,
Turning down good offers, ready to dive,
I can see the blue sea on the horizon, but no thanks,
I’m content with my poor life choices, I’ve settled in the chuckhole.
