The Unknown Valley of Afterlife
- Miegrat Sammri


Deep down a dark valley, unknown to man,
Shrouded in night, hidden from sight.
The home of devils, or so it is told,  
With a vision of hell, thanks to whispers of old.

It is a loathing place, no doubt
Yet no one dares to question why
Before heaven, all must tread there, 
It's a valley we share as dead.

All sorrows are washed in that stream,
Cleansing the soul of its venom and scheme.
The bones are rearranged, the flesh remade,
A body reborn from the ashes decayed.

That place is not end, merely a beginning anew,
Yet every heart trembles, every spirit too.
The energy to remake what death has unmade,
It's where the life and death consolidate.
