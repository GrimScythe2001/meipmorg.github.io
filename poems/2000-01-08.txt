Disturbed Cries
- Miegrat Sammri


Disturbed, anxious, exhausted,
My crying heart beats tears of sorrow,
Yet the frail pride pumping through my flesh and bones,
Fails to let my eyes go wet.

It’s harsh, not knowing how to reflect pain.
This pretend mask I’ve worn for eons,
I’ve forgotten how to take it off,
even when I’m alone.

My mind’s disturbed, my heart’s disturbed,
It keeps me awake at night; I'm sleepless,
This waning frame of the wavering occupant,
The whole foundation's disturbed all along.

O' unloving god, wherever, or whether you are,
I’ve known evil, and I’ve known pain.
Deliver me from myself,
And from all I’ve repressed within myself.
