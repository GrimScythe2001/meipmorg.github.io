I Hate It Here
- Miegrat Sammri


Tired as a stuffed doll,
I can’t move a muscle.
Living’s been bleeding me dry,
Earning’s been a hustle.

Wake up early, stay up late,
Insomnia's steering the wheel.
Anxiety’s front two wheels,
While ADHD's at the rear.
Driving me straight into depression.

Been rotting in a matchbox room,
Keeping my head stuck in, least I burn,
Never planned to be alive this long.
Man, this life sucks.

Be a gentleman, be a nice guy,
I was taught to be polite.
Life has a funny way of punishing
Those who run from its fight.

Why does this body demand food
Three times a day?
I can’t plan, can’t cook,
And buying’s out of my pay.

School was for learning, 
Office is for earning,
One day I will live my life free, 
I keep swearing.

I may drive a hard bargain, 
But my fate's grown bored again
Dangles a heavier bait,
To reel me right back in.

Then comes the weekend,
Only to stretch the hours thin.
You sit with your pathetic little life,
And pray the dear lord for lightning to strike you in.

This life’s been killing me,
The older I get, the sharper the regret.
Should have taken my life when I was feeling it.
Breathe in, breathe out, this odd sensation's been lingering,
For every air I take to live, I wish the world didn't keep billing me.

So show me mercy,
Or show me the light.
I cannot put up to this fight.
There are millions others just like me,
Go torment them,
And let go of my kite.
