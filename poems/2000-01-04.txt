Envy
- Miegrat Sammri


Just once, I wanna wake up and feel at ease,
Feel weightless with optimism; believe my life's pure bliss.
Give me one good reason why I should be living.
Better not tell me to keep on believing, when the light inside me is dimming.

I envy the ones who drift so free,
We are on the same-sinking boat, yet they smile while I barely exist.
A swarm of hustlers slaving for their queen,
We worker bees don't deserve to live.
