Assure Me Something
- Miegrat Sammri


I forced all the air in,
My lungs ache within,
My head is ringing,
Now I am fearing, I will go deaf.

What if I won't hear my calling?
My mental state's tearing up,
I am hearing voices,
All these murmurs, whispers,
There's white noise in my mind.

Pushing through the clouds,
I am falling to the ground,
I missed the landing,
Still, I'm going down.

Swimming through the depthless ocean,
I am compelled to find the bottom,
Fighting sharks with bare hands,
Wish I had a cheat gun, I couldâ€™ve shot 'em.

Would've made my progress easier,
Instead I'm wasting up my leisure,
Just to make my godforsaken life,
even more goddamn busier.

But I'm fighting more than sharks though,
All these nameless monsters circling my luck,
They steal while I'm sleeping, 
Leave me with a day even worse so.

They creep close enough,
for me to feel their presence linger,
Not a day goes by,
Where my depression has not given me a seizure.

How long do I gotta keep up?
I'd like to get a measure of my lifeline,
Assure me with a pat on my head,
that all's going to be fine.

Show me a sign,
For once in my life I would like to breathe a sigh,
Give me a rest, 
tell me if it's okay for me to die... or to dine.
