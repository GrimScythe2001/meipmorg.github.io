Keep Your Distance, I Am Harm to You
- Miegrat Sammri

 
My heart cries,
but my eyes stay dry.
I feel bad, deep inside,
yet I project nothing but cold, stout hate.
 
A million apologies run wild in my head,
but what leaves my mouth
is unapologetic dismissal.
I’ll bury what I feel
just to make it easier for you
to loathe me without hesitation.
 
Because I don’t want to hurt you
Put you in harm's way, because I am harm to you.
You don’t understand how bad I am,
I haven’t even fully realised it myself.

My actions violate my thoughts.
I do wrong, knowing it’s wrong,
but I do it to keep you far away.
Better for you to hate me now
than stand too close to me and suffer harm for real.

I don’t need you to understand.
I need you to hate me, indefinitely.
Hate me enough to keep your distance.
Hate me enough that you never come back.

Because I am harm to you.
I am harm to me.
And I can’t live with the hypothetical scenario
of hurting you over and over,
knowing I could never undo it,
knowing there's not a damn thing I can do,
to punish myself enough.
