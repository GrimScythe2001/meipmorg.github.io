Counting Days
- Miegrat Sammri

First piece of poetry I every wrote. 


Lonely me, thence lonely world,
No fun, no work does it hold.
Sitting by the window and gazing at the bay,
I’m counting grains and counting days.

Slowly does it pass, with no hobbies and no aim;
Life ain’t just a game, matter not what others say.
Looking at the calendar, with nothing to do,
Just counting years and counting days.

Alone on the strand, a pioneer so gay,
Not caring what others hafta say.
Lying on the ground and watching the sky,
I’m counting stars and counting days.

A private island, a private yacht,
And a private company of myself.
By the ocean, staring at the watch,
I’m counting hours and counting days.

So messy has life become,
So unruly have dreams become.
Help myself, I may,
But by counting thoughts and counting days?..

Loads of work, but none to worry,
Wasted my leisure, felt no sorry.
No idea what my future holds,
But I am sure,
It’ll, as usual, pass by
Just counting rays and counting days...
