Snake
- Miegrat Sammri

This poem is a summary of the poem "Snake" by D.H. Lawrence, written in my own words (as a part of my school assignment).


Out of the black pit as I emerged,
Frogs and rats quickly dispersed,
I looked up at the blinding sun,
O’ it was a hot day, yet another one.

I came upon the water trough,
The farmer’s, I think, it belongs to.
I hope he wouldn’t really mind,
If I drank some water on his land.

As I was licking the dusty ground,
The farmer approached without a sound.
He looked afraid, but hopeful as well,
A bit confused, and somewhat amused.

I wanted to give him a chance too, you see,  
The trough belonged to him, not me.
So I drank quickly, very fast,
The water droplets, till the very last.

At last I finished, I raised my head, 
Quietly, calmly, I trotted ahead, 
Into the garden,
Into the bushes, I disappeared.
