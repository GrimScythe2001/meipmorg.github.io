Be A Man You'd Never Been
- Miegrat Sammri

This poem comes from a hopeless guy who one day believes to rise to his full potential, and *hopes* to see his true self, without any extrinsic help.


When you believe the sky above is far too high
For you to even try
That’s when all your bright dreams twist awry
And you just sit there, doing nothing but cry…
That's when you fail...

When you believe the ocean’s too deep for even your tears to drown
That’s when all your greenest faiths fade brown
and all you can do is wear that frown…
That's when you are unworthy...

When you finally believe the journey to the world’s end can’t be accomplished
And you let every chance slip into the abyss
That’s when you let your future go to lease
And let sorrow itself give you its kiss…
That's when you are hopeless... 

But amidst all your sorrows and sufferings and failures
If you still stand up each time
And let life itself test you one more time
That's when you reach beyond the sky
That’s when you touch the depths of the bottomless ocean
And that’s when you finally break the earth’s grasp…

Then you start a new life
Full of hopes and full of dreams
All your faded faiths turned green again
That's when you rise to your full potential
To be the man you had never been…
