Sweet Misery
- Miegrat Sammri


Oh, sweet, sweet misery,
Why can't I end you with me?
Why won't you set me free?

When the high comes, so do the lows,
When pain falters, so do my hopes.
Oh, my betrothed, my failure,
Why do I love you even more?

It's yet another sleepless night,
I keep waking up, lost in this fight,
Oh, my fateful, fateless sorrow,
Why do you taunt my tomorrows?

They say, he who falls will rise up mightier,
Yet when I fall, the land beneath disappears,
Oh, my endless, timeless fall,
I soar your depths, I crave your call.
