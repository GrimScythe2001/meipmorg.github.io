Petty Life
- Miegrat Sammri


All just for some petty job
And petty cash and petty life.

All that's gonna disappear,
Leap in fear, leave like leer.

I wish I could end it all,
Now, bail myself out and ditch the haul.

Only if I had the strength,
To lift my soul or kill 'em all.

I say,
Was it worth the take?!
This petty life they gave!
Living by their rules
In the haze of blues.

I say,
I'd rather take my life,
Than keep up with the strife.
Rid myself of the toll,
I just wanna free my soul.
Yeah!
