Deep Down, I Am A Different Person
- Miegrat Sammri


I may talk a lot on the outside,
But deep down, I have a lot of secrets,
The untold things I never wish to tell,
Many secrets that I claim to myself.

I smile a lot on the outside, even though
Deep inside, I've never done so,
Because deep within, I am a different person,
A person whom you will never know.

I am nice to a lot of people on the outside,
But believe me,
I've murdered every single one of them on the inside,
A psychopath I am very deep within,
Very different from my outer being.

Partying and socialising is not my thing,
Neither is teamwork or collaborating,
Lonely I am, very deep within,
And alone I always wish to be.

The dark evil has conquered my mind,
And the goodwill refuges on the surface outside,
I do not tend to fight my evil within,
Because it's who I've always been.

I am not my true self,
The person you see on the outside,
Because deep down, I am a different person,
The person you'd never wish to meet.
