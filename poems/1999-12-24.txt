I Have A Choice
- Miegrat Sammri


To be born was never my choice,
But to end it, that shall be mine,
To march this ruined planet was not my choice,
But the choice to leave it is finally mine.

I have seen much,
I have suffered enough,
All of it came without a choice,
But now, I have a choice.
A choice to change, a final exchange,
Change so deep, I'll never be seen again,
Not on this planet,
Not in this universe,
Not in any corner of this dimensionless multiverse.

I don't need no help no more,
And that is my choice,
I'll take no advice no more,
Because I choose to refuse,
And that's my choice; Mine alone.

When every option burned away,
When every bright path shut close that day,
In that pitch black night, 
A dark flame sprang to life.
I chose to follow it,
I chose to allow it,
Lead my journey off the edge.

I came to realise, 
All along, the dark flame was my choice,
The final choice anyone could possess.
I choose death over life,
I choose to die,
And die, and die, again and again,
Until this choice too,
Eventually no longer remains mine.
