Do I Wake Up Again?
- Miegrat Sammri

 
I’ve been thinking…
And then what?
Do I wake up again?
Or do I remain dead?
 
Is that it?
It’s such an abstract concept,
Life and death.
Living for what?
Lifeless, and gone to what?
What’s the purpose?
What’s the goal?
More importantly,
What’s the motive to it all?
 
I hope there’s no life after death,
Yet I can’t imagine,
How could there be nothing after death.
I just hope that once I’m gone,
I don’t wake up again.
That I stay thoughtless.
That I remain dead.
