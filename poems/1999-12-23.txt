I Loathe Humans
- Miegrat Sammri


With horrid faces,
Come the hypocritical races.
They are the friend misled,
By an enemy deeply seated.

Love they seem to give,
But loving they are not.
Care they seem to take,
But it’s a trap that leads to hate.

You’ll be lied to,
They’ll make you think you’ll gain.
By the passing nights, you’ll know,
Your trust’s s'posed to give you but endless pain.

There’s a foe,
You’ll ultimately know,
That’s ever ready to destroy you.
With slightest chance it gets,
Swiftly, it will act.
Quietly, it will kill.
And then all is gone,
All you ever had is lost.

Humans, they are called,
The race.
This race I hate the most.
