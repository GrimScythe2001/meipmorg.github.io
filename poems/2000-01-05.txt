Dreams Realised Someday
- Miegrat Sammri


I lie awake in the dead of night,
Wondering what drives me to relentlessy fight.
Do I truly believe that someday I'll be happy?
That all this toil will set me free?

Am I seriously that naive to think that one day,
I will live fully?
So much so,
Instead of counting every breath I draw in this wretched skin,
I'll cherish heartbeats that skip within?

Is this but a dream,
Before I close my eyes and I actually dream?
A false reassurance to my weary heart
That it keep on beating the next day, just the same.
I speak as if I hold any command over my involuntary actions
While in reality, I can't even blink without my puppeteer's permission.

I can barely steer the raft I am given,
Far-fetched are my desires to tame the sea I'm tossed in,
Every now and then, a couple of grand ships sail by,
Mocking my ill fate with hopeful visions that someday...
Someday, I'll row a large ship that I can't afford,
Leave the sea, and cruise the ocean unexplored.
Someday, maybe, just someday...
I'll master the art of deceiving myself,
Convince my fragile delusion that my raft has at least now become a modest boat,
It's not far off from the ships I once sought,
If I relentlessly keep hammering Noah's Ark,
Perhaps even a yacht will be mine, who knows...

And here, I drift into sleep, way past midnight...
