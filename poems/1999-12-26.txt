I Entrust You My Soul
- Miegrat Sammri


Heartbreak,
living through this hard pain.
Nobody really gets it,
cheer up's all they keep sayin'

If cheering up was so simple,
Then why the world's in so much pain
You think we suffer for fun?
You think we've got something to gain, through this pain?

Body ache
slips into heartache.
Is my end now coming?
I am glad its near, I have nothing to fear

Come get me,
Fall me standing,
Don't wake me up after I go sleeping,
I am praying,
for my wait to the sound of morning alarm to be eternal.

You think I’m faking?
You think I’ll run off to my blankie,
when the reaper's at my door, aknocking?
You’re mistaken.
I'll greet him,
Offer reaper a proper cup of tea and some biscuits,
I am not delusional, I will embrace my sorry ending

I know I’m dreaming.
Death isn’t so polite to send fake death god to your door
But this lie keeps me breathing.
Every god to their own, and reaper's what I believe in

He walks behind me,
Looks over my shoulder when I am walking through this life
Grabs me by the shoulder,
Picks me up when I lean towards false light.

I embrace your darkness.
I know it's your boot that kicks me off the edge,
Still, I give you my life
I entrust you my soul
So either guide me to the end,
or take the wheel, I’m done driving.
