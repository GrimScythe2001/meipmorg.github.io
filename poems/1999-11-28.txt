What Makes Us Alive?
- Miegrat Sammri


Who even am I?  
An insignificant fabric of thought in someoneâ€™s mind.  
Does my real name matter?  
Or, for that matter, does even my alias?  
 
What makes me alive, what keeps me alive?  
Is thought itself my only identity?  
I am you, you are me, 
What thread truly separates you from me?

I think differently than you lot.  
You lot think differently from one another.  
And that, 
That difference grants you identity,  
A fragile sense of uniqueness,  
A sensible being.

But we are still industry-made,
Shaped, manufactured, you and me.  
Coming from the same assembly line,  
We are a flock of sheep,  
Only a fraction apart  
In the gears of our heads above.
