I See Evil In Everything
- Miegrat Sammri


Wherever I go, I see lies,
Lies in me, lies in them,
Lies in God and lies in belief.
The foundation of the world is based on deceit,
Am I the only one who sees it this way?

The innocence of a child, soon to turn to hypocrisy,
I see a child grow up with irrationalityâ€”an irrational mind.
Even in his smallest, purest form,
I see evil take root within him.
Is it just my heterodoxy that sees shadows foreshadowing a child?

I see negativity everywhere, every time,
The rotten hearts of the world's great leaders,
The vicious visions of the so-called saints,
Even among peace-fighters with selfless deeds,
Oh my! Surely, it must be me who's in the wrong.

I don't appraise the sunlight grace a man,
For I know it will soon be night.
Burning through the wick, I fear, every virtue has to meet its match,
And it's the rival who emerges victorious every time.

The light in the universe flares only there,
Where darkness' mercy prevails and thence, obscures itself.
Such is the lens through which I view the world,
Clouded is my vision through the depths of the evil brewing in my mind.

I see evil and shadows cast everywhere...
Or wait, is it truth and reality unfolding before my eyes?
