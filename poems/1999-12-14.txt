My time's unchanged
- Miegrat Sammri


Time may have shifted, but the hours I wasted cling the same.  
The regret-soaked hands of the clock refuse their ticking,
As if mocking me, reminding how once I froze and dropped moving forward,  
And that single pause erased my life, stole the rest of my stride.
