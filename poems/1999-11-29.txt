What Better Am I?
- Miegrat Sammri


Everyday, every second I have suicidal thoughts on my mind
But the calculations and the arrangements are so grand in my head
That I've never actually had a chance to attempt an end on my life
I am not proud of it, because I know it's what I must do in the end
Fantasising own's death may seem like excess in your head
But bear in mind it's not yours, but my life in my hand

I may seem like a naive kid who's not seen anything in this world
To go into depression and talk about killing oneself for a change
But it's a mental illness that's got nothing to do with undergoing hardship for the pain
Getting my hands full for a day
I am a rational individual with a bleak future for my fate
I've already analysed the situation enough to choose this destiny for myself
It's a cheap way to go, but it's better than the mortality's debt
From my viewpoint, it's already way past my time
For the better or the worse, all the doors seem to shut close on my face

I have some limitations that I pray overcome
What better am I if I can't live, nor can I take my own life
What good does it do if I can only fantasise but not act what I dream
Easy way to live, if not, at least an easy way out
Is it too much to ask for my own sake

No guts, no glory, I can't even do this one thing voluntarily
I am such a failure I can't even begin to comprehend
Is it a curse for me to feel the pain of my future that is yet to come
At least give me strength to bear the failures of my distant life
Who am I kidding, who am I praying, there's nobody coming to my aid
I am an atheist, I have lost all faith in god
I loathe humanity I have already lost faith in them too
Who am I asking for help then, I reckon I am all alone in the end

Living's not an easy choice for me to opt-in
But I guess it's what my life demands of me for the time being
Until all the necessary arrangements have been made
I may as well live and suffer for the time being
Heed my words it's only for the time being
The first chance I get, I am taking it
A cowardly but a dear exit from this world
