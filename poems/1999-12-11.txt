Perhaps in the next life
- Miegrat Sammri


Perhaps in the next life,
I’ll be born to cherish every little thing,
Gleefully smile all the while, all the time,
Every moment I will hum, I will sing,
Perhaps in a wealthy house, I'll be raised to be a king.

Perhaps in the next life,  
I’ll make true friends, find love, find home,  
stroll by the bay with my children’s hands holding my own,
live a quiet life, surrounded by the people whom I hold most dear.

Perhaps in the next life,
I will spread my wings, fly high, soar the vast sky
or dive deep, swim the bottomless pit of the ocean nigh
Perhaps rule the forest, wild and free,
I'll be born a jungle king.

Perhaps in the next life,
I will not be so miserable,
Perhaps in the next life,
I will find my strength to stand.
