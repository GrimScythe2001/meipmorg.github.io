Hey, How Are You?!
- Miegrat Sammri


“Hey, how are you?!”
“I’m good. And you?!”
“Glad to hear, I’m good too.”
You have no idea what I’m going through.

“Hey, let’s catch a movie.”
“No thanks, I’m busy.”
“Come on now, don’t be an ass.”
I said I'm busy, I have to cry myself to sleep.

“What do you do? How much do you earn?”
“Just enough to live my life long.”
“I bet you’re rich, you're well-sewn.”
Right, that’s why I feel like killing myself all day long.

“If not a movie, then let’s play a game.”
“I can’t, I don’t know how to aim.”
“Don’t lie, I’ve seen you play.”
With my life, yeah, and it ain't going so well.

"Now give up, just tell us what you've got.
What’s hiding behind that oH-sO-sEkRaTiVe mask?”
You wouldn't want to know, I'd tell you that.
But I know that's not an answer you'd want, so I'll tell you what.

The lies to keep you all away from me.
The lies that say I’m just a normal kid.
Yes, the happy mask I wear is a lie,
But you wouldn't care, for that's not what you want.
You want to see a happy guy you can be envious of,
A self-sufficient man you can spite about behind his back.

So that's what I'll be.
"What mask?" I'll ask.
"There's no secret, I'm just a working lad,
Earning my bread to feed my otherwise occupied life…"
of self-worthlessness.

“It was nice to meet you, see you around.”
“Same here, see you too.”
‘The guy’s no fun, hope to never see him again.’
I bet that’s what’s going in your head.

I’ll save you the trouble, the feeling’s mutual.
But I don’t mind nor do I care.
I’ve already understood the humour of this world.
So let me get back to my comfort, my four walls serenity,
And write poems about how badly I want to kill myself.
