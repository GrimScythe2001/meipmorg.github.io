Have You Come For Me?
- Miegrat Sammri


What has befallen this starry night? The moon shines blight,
The charcoal darkness of great peril.

I can tell it's ill-omen at play, darkening the day,
Sinister-ing dark times that lie ahead.

Why does the strong wind hush, this thrilling rush?
The howling silence has just swept across.

I can feel my calling close, the whispers of those,
Not a soul as far as my senses can touch.

What makes the land beneath me quiver, dread and seizure?
The feeling of terror has enveloped my mind.

I can make no heads or tails of what tonight entails,
The wailing end of the whole wide world.

Who stands there in that darkness, who glows of blackness?
Your aura is one of awe and strength.

I know you haven't come for me, so leave me be.
Brush aside my cry, just turn away.
