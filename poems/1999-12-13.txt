Never Alone
- Miegrat Sammri


As invisible as you may be,
your presence cannot be ignored.
As silent as you may stand,
your voice will not be scorned.

It matters not if you know them,  
for they may already know you.  
Being alone may bring you peace,  
Yet they're always there to comfort you. 

There are people you may not care for,  
but they still care for you.  
There are people you may not forgive, ever,  
but they have forgiven you.

Anger, rage, fight and forget,
such is the circle of life.  
But to realise, apologise, care and forgive,  
that is the lesson of life.  

Choose wisely, choose good,  
be kind and live true.  
For your choices will shape not only yourself,  
but all the lives around you.
