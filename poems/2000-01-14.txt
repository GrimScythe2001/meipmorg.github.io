Beloved Death
- Miegrat Sammri


Die if I shall,
Then none shall cry nor sigh,
For I never meant to live
And have taken what I longed for…

Death is what I wanted,
From the moment I was torn,
For who wants to live,
In a crooked world, forever sworn…

Day by day, the only thing I crave to taste
Is the taste of death,
Matters not if that death
Comes from cowardice or from the brave…

So long have I waited,
And at last, the day has come,
A goodbye to this world,
That has provided me none…

I quit…
