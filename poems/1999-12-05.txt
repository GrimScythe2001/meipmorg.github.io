The Rain of Blood and Tear
- Miegrat Sammri


I fear. Yes, I fear,  
The rain of blood and tear.  
I fear, oh my dear,  
I fear your crimson tear.  

Just a droplet, enough to form an ocean,
The ocean of blood and tear,
Feeding upon my fate,
my cursed pain, and my fear.

I see. Oh, I see you, 
My eyes are wide open,
I feel. Oh, I feel the pain,
Burning through those tears.

I wish I could help you,  
But itâ€™s me who needs help.  
I wish I could save you,  
but first, can I save myself?
