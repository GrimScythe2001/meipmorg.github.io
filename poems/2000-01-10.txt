Dead Harmony
- Miegrat Sammri


I can tell there’s no harmony between my body and my mind,
Yet I don’t understand why my soul still claws to live on.
It was luck, not choice; And somehow, I lucked out,
I could’ve had it easy… if only I’d been born in a different household.

Generational wealth...
But instead I inherited generations of pain,
Hate my place, my face, my fate; I hate all of myself,
Toxic traits; I’m arrogant, so why do I still think I’m better than everyone else?!

No, you don’t have to tell, it’s rhetorical,
I’m insolent, I won’t listen; I know it for myself.
I’ve figured it all out, and I blame it on my parents,
Yep, there’s something deeply wrong in my head.

Dead neurons plague my mind,
Hollow feelings sit by my side,
I hope I can be the end of my kind.
Looking forward to the end of this eternal time-bind.

My purpose is shallow,
My visions for my future, my destination's faltered.
Aim for the stars and you’ll reach the moon,
Where will I land when I’m cursed to lose?!

Brought up from a never-heard land,
I’ve tethered my destiny to the nether-land.
I’ll serve penance every day I breathe in this land,
Slander myself, slander my best; I’ll slander all beliefs and faiths.
Until the divine is coerced to pluck me from this sick land.
