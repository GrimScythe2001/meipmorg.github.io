Who Am I To You?
- Miegrat Sammri


I'll be there when you call onto me,  
By your side, abiding silently.  
Tell me of sorrow, or happy memories you’ve found,  
I’ll listen to your complaints or cheer when you’re proud.  

I am not your enemy, not even your frenemy,  
Nor confuse me for a friend, you see.
I’ll be your shoulder, the confidence you seek.
Your fleeting support, a radiant presence,
I may stay a while, but soon I must go.

You’ve already trusted me with your passcode,  
Your email, your bank, the secrets you hold.
I may not be you friend,
But I won't leak it, I won't betray,
Your trust remains safe, I won't use them for gain.

I am someone, something, I myself do not know
Already tired of your yapping, but I wont let it show
I pull away, yet you won’t let me go, 
I wish you no fortune, neither ill nor good,
I linger an acquiescent being, as neutral shadows would,
Was I dropped in your life, or did you find me true?
Whatever the case, the gratitude fades soon,
With time, our transient acquaint must shed.

For I am not your friend, let me be clear, I never will be,
Not then, not now, not for eternity.
You are only my penance to end. I have no bond to bend. 
I just exist, and I just am.
