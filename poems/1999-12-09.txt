Sat This One Out
- Miegrat Sammri


I sense it's a silent night,
They're gonna hear me take the flight,
So I'll sit this one out.

It's 4 a.m. in the morn,
Morning songbirds chirp their song.
Dawn's too early for my turn; guess I'll sit this one out.

Today sounds a bit rowdy,
The streets seem overly crowdy.
I can't step out; they'll see me. I'll sit this one out.

There seems to be an event happening.
I can see fancy people gathering.
My curiosity's boiling, but my anxiety's smothering;
I'll sit this one out.

Oh, look, the light's fading.
The day's gone by too soon; the night's closing in.
What can be done at this ungodly hour?
Iâ€™d better sit this one out too.

Dispersing figures proliferate through the window,
And a myriad of void, fear, and self-doubt is sown within my soul.
Shining diamonds gleamed throughout their day,
While I kept making excuses, sitting my chances out.
