Dont Make Me Suffer
- Miegrat Sammri


Strike me dead already, oh Lord,
Why do you make me suffer?
If you can’t give me strength to cope,
Then just don’t make me suffer.

All these voices in my head, yeah,
They keep dragging me down.
Flashes of a dark future ahead,
I can’t make them stop.

You made me good at nothing, oh Lord,
But you stopped partway.
You made me good at suffering,
Even when I’ve had enough.

This anxiety is driving me crazy, please,
Spare me this curse.
Strike me dead already, oh Lord,
And relieve me of my misery.

I can feel my body go numb,
I can feel my heart fail,
I can feel the throbbing pain, in my head
I don't understand these cursed thoughts, in my head
But I can see my future bleak, crystal clear, in my head.
If it's all in my head, then why do I worry?
Why do I cry every time these thoughts cross my mind?

I beg you, oh Lord,
I’ve had enough.
I’ve seen it all, felt it all,
I have known enough pain to last thirteen of my lifetimes.

Now just smite me dead,
And rid me of my misery.
I can take no more, oh Lord,
Please don’t make me suffer.
Please don’t make me suffer, I beg,
I don’t wanna suffer anymore.
