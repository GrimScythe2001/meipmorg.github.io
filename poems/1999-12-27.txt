I Am Fine, Just Leave Me Alone
- Miegrat Sammri


I’ll be watching from far above
When you read my suicide note.

Nobody’s to blame, for what I did
Don’t point fingers, it’s nobody’s fault.

If anything’s to blame,
It’s the destiny I was born with.
It’s the sickness growing in my mind.

I have coped long enough.
I have seen it all.
I have learned the shape of this crooked world.

Life was always out of reach.
Like every other skill I lack,
Living is an art I wasn't adept at.
I was nothing more than a burden
To this hell on earth.

There, I’ve said it.
It wasn’t so hard.
Maybe it’s my illness talking.
But I’m fine.
Leave me alone.
I’m fine,
At least as far as my physical form is concerned.
